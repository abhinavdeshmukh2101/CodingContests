<h2>New Olympic Game<br></h2>
       <p>  <br>
       We have to reach from <b>m</b> to <b>n</b> in minimum steps.We will start from destination(<b>n</b>) to source (<b>m</b>). If <b>n</b> is even then we will divide it by 2 and if  <b>n</b> is odd then ww will add 1(as in our problem we have substract 1 from current position). We will do this until the <b>n</b> is less than or equal to <b>m</b>.</p>
